# IPPA-data
Example datasets for IPPA, including 

- Input data format
- Input data
  - JSON format
  - CSV format (patient informatio, hosptial information, and healthcare records)
- Output data
- Output figures


All the input data in this repository are artifical and designed for testing and demonstrating the IPPA codes.
We simulated based on real data analysis results, and we jittered and shuffled data point before releasing. 
Therefore, our input data (in this repo) has no responsibility to answer any epidemiological question. 
However, the figures without 'Simulated' marks are generated from real data. Please do not try to compare the results from the artifical inputs with the real output figures. Thank you.
